# Welcome to GitHub Pages

> I have just recently finished an intensive 12 week Python programming course, hosted by Generation UK&I. This github page will be used to present my progression within coding 
> and to showcase the current projects I've been working on within my own time whilst also showing my development with future projects. 

## Experience
> So far, I've been introduced to cloud engineering within AWS and have experience using SQL databases and queries. This experience came via an interactive, terminal based drink > app I created within my first 6 weeks of learning Python in the aforementioned course.
